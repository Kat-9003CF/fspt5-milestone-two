# Full Stack Development Test - Week Two

This assessment tests your understanding of classes, testing, HOFs and list-type data structures.

## Guidelines

- The resources you may use online are:
  - [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
  - [Chai docs](https://www.chaijs.com/api/)
- Make sure you give yourself a grade before turning it in!

## Tips

- Use your whiteboard to draw the problem.
- Write pseudocode before writing code.

## Steps to run the test

```bash
yarn
yarn test
```

## Self-Assessment

Give yourself a grade for each question. Explain why you gave yourself that grade.

| Grade | Explanation                                                        |
| :---: | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
|   4   | I understood this completely and did not struggle answering it.    |
|   3   | I think I did well, but I didn't totally understand why it worked. |
|   2   | I think I was close, but I didn't get the answer.                  |
|   1   | I am struggling with this question.                                |
|   0   | I did not attempt this question (explain why)                      |

### 1. Create and extend classes

- Grade: 4
- Explanation: I was happy with this task

### 2. Create tests for classes

- Grade: 3/4
- Explanation: I understood this and the trial and error came from wanting to create a method with an if loop.

### 3. Use HOFs from the Array prototype

- Grade: 3?
- Explanation: Once I realised I needed to use two seperate functions on the array it made sense. I started off trying to do it in one step. So it took me a while, but I'm happy with how and why my solution works.

### 4. Create the reverse linked list method

- Grade: 2/3
- Explanation: I sort of messed this task up. I read through the pseudocode before realising that was optional. Not sure how I missed that as it says so very clearly! I didn't have any problems at all following the pseudocode. I think I'd have got some of the way to solving this without it - the second bit of code is a sort of 'what I would have done' code.
